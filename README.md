## EduMate 

### App Description
An app for school where people can go to find other people at their school who are taking the same courses. This app would make it easy to find people to study with and make friends in your class.

### App Idea Evaluation
- Mobile: People can view people in their classes on the go
- Story: Our peers will probably enjoy this app, considering that most of our peers are in college and may not know everyone in their large lecture classes
- Market: This app is geared towards students, mainly college students
- Habit: Users will most likely use this app a few time a week
- Scope: We may have the oportunity to create this app once we finish the course
